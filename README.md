JavaFX is a new framework for developing Java GUI programs. The JavaFX API is an
excellent example of how the object-oriented principles are applied. This chapter serves two
purposes. First, it presents the basics of JavaFX programming. Second, it uses JavaFX to
demonstrate object-oriented design and programming. Specifically, this chapter introduces
the framework of JavaFX and discusses JavaFX GUI components and their relationships. You
will learn how to develop simple GUI programs using layout panes, buttons, labels, text fields,
colors, fonts, images, image views, and shapes.

Swing and AWT are replaced by the JavaFX platform for developing rich Internet
applications.
When Java was introduced, the GUI classes were bundled in a library known as the Abstract
Windows Toolkit (AWT). AWT is fine for developing simple graphical user interfaces, but not
for developing comprehensive GUI projects. In addition, AWT is prone to platform-specific
bugs. The AWT user-interface components were replaced by a more robust, versatile, and flexible
library known as Swing components. Swing components are painted directly on canvases
using Java code. Swing components depend less on the target platform and use less of the
native GUI resources. Swing is designed for developing desktop GUI applications. It is now
replaced by a completely new GUI platform known as JavaFX. JavaFX incorporates modern
GUI technologies to enable you to develop rich Internet applications. A rich Internet application
(RIA) is a Web application designed to deliver the same features and functions normally
associated with deskop applications. A JavaFX application can run seemlessly on a desktop
and from a Web browser. Additionally, JavaFX provides a multi-touch support for touchenabled
devices such as tablets and smart phones. JavaFX has a built-in 2D, 3D, animation
support, video and audio playback, and runs as a stand-alone application or from a browser.
This book teaches Java GUI programming using JavaFX for two reasons. First, JavaFX is
much simpler to learn and use for new Java programmers. Second, Swing is essentially dead,
because it will not receive any further enhancement. JavaFX is the new GUI tool for developing
cross-platform-rich Internet applications on desktop computers, on hand-held devices, and
on the Web.
